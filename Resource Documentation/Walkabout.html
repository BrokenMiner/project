	<p style="text-align:center;">Thanks for choosing the <strong>Walkabout Navigation Toolkit</strong>.
	Please read the EULA below before installing or using the kit - or at least the summary!
	Use the links above to view the documentation files, or go to the discussion forums to get help.
	It's been a long road to bring the kit this far, but I sincerely hope you are satisfied with it, and
	wish you the best of luck with all your projects!</p>
	<p style="text-align:right;">Daniel Buckmaster</p>

	<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
	<p>This product derives many of its features from the Recast library, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation/">freely-available</a> open-source navmesh generation library.
	This library was not written by me, and it is freely available for anyone to use.
	I'd like to make it very clear that I am hugely indebted to Mikko Mononen, the author of Recast, both for his work and for allowing me to sell this product.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21392">Recast Resource</a> makes use of <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/community/blogs/view/21132">Lethal Concepts' Recast meshloader resource</a> to parse geometry.
	That code has been replaced in this product.</p>

	<p>The logo for this product was created using source from <a href="http://cgtextures.com">cgtextures.com</a>.
	This image may not be redistributed by default.
	Visit <a href="http://cgtextures.com">cgtextures.com</a> for more information.</p>

	<h1>EULA</h1>
	<p>Please read before installing or making use of the <strong>Walkabout Navigation Toolkit</strong>.

	If you do not agree with the terms below, please do not install or make use of this product.</p>

	<h2>1. Summary</h2>
	<p>You can use the source code and tools in this software to create your own game with the Torque 3D game engine, subject to a few restrictions.
	You can&rsquo;t distribute the source code or tools to non-licensees.
	You may modify the source code, but you may not sell, rent, or distribute to non-licensees your derivative code.
	Torque 3D binaries with this product compiled into them may be distributed.
	Editor plugin source code may not be distributed, even in compiled form.
	These conditions don&rsquo;t apply to source files that originate in the open-source Recast/Detour library or the Torque 3D game engine.
	These conditions are also waived for any source file that contains header comments to the effect that they are freely distributable.</p>

	<h2>2. Definitions</h2>
	<p>You, the "Licensee" have been licensed, not sold, the <strong>Walkabout Navigation Toolkit</strong>,
	including all downloaded source code and documentation (the "Software"),
	with the exception of source files distributed within the Recast/Detour library ("Recast") or the Torque 3D game engine ("Torque")
	or under a permissive license in file headers, by the "Licensor" Daniel Buckmaster.
	This "License" is subject to the terms and conditions set down in this document, the "Agreement".</p>

	<h2>3. Use of open-source software</h2>
	<p>This product contains source code from the open-source Recast library written by Mikko Mononen and distributed under its own license.
	It also contains modified versions of source code from the open-source Torque 3D game engine,
	and original source code released under a permissive license.
	The terms in this Agreement shall not cover the particular source code files that appear in Recast or Torque,
	or are explicitly placed under a permissive license in comments.
	The Licensor claims no ownership of or liability for source code that is part of Recast or Torque.
	The Licensor claims full compliance with the terms of Recast&rsquo;s license and Torque&rsquo;s license.</p>

	<h2>4. License</h2>
	<p>The Licensor grants the Licensee the following rights pertaining to the Software:</p>
	<ol class="eula">
		<li>To employ the Sofware, or source code derived from it, in developing video games or other interactive computer programs in conjunction with Torque 3D.</li>
		<li>To distribute binaries or object code of Torque 3D that the Software has been compiled into.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Licensee is prohibited from:</p>
	<ol class="eula">
		<li>Distributing or making available the Software except to other Licensees.
		This includes making the Software available on the Internet with no protection, or where it may be accessed by non-Licensees.</li>
		<li>Selling, renting or otherwise transferring their License to non-Licensees.</li>
		<li>Using the Software or any source code derived from it to create a competing product.</li>
		<li>Entering into this Agreement if doing so would break any obligations the Licensee may have towards a third party.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The Licensor is entitled to terminate the License and therefore the rights of the Licensee granted by this Agreement should the Licensee be found to be in breach of these terms.
	In such cases, the Licensor has the right to request that the Licensee destroy all copies of the Software.</p>

	<h2>5. Warranty</h2>
	<p>The Software is provided as-is with no guarantee, express or implied, of its correct operation or fitness for a particular purpose.
	Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusions of an implied warranty, so this disclaimer may not apply and there may be other legal rights available that vary by jurisdiction.</p>

	<h2>6. Liability</h2>
	<p>Under no circumstances shall the Licensor be liable to the Licensee or any other person for damages direct, indirect or circumstantial,
	legal actions or expenses relating to the installation or use of the Software.
	Installation and use of the Software is entirely at the risk of the Licensee.</p>
